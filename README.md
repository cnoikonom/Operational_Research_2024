## Project Overview

The project focuses on solving two optimization problems:

### 1. Flight Landing Scheduling
**Objective:** Minimize the total penalty for aircraft landings at an airport with a single runway.
- Each aircraft has a time window within which it must land.
- Early or late landings incur penalties.
- A minimum time gap between consecutive landings must be maintained.

### 2. Fuel Delivery Route Optimization
**Objective:** Minimize the total distance traveled while delivering heating oil to multiple cities.
- A transport company must fulfill fuel demands for customers across different locations.
- A fleet of tankers with a fixed capacity is used for the deliveries.
- The shortest route satisfying demand constraints needs to be determined.
